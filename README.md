ArrowPointing
=============

This small project tries to follow an arrow and output the character it is
pointing to. It follows the code golfing of described at 
http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/57952/where-is-the-arrow-pointing
except it does not golf :-)

Examples are given in the test directory.
